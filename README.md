# IoT-Data-Collection-and-Machine-Learning-Model-Development-for-Temperature-Prediction

Worked on a project involving the collection of IoT sensor data and the application of machine learning algorithms to predict current temperature based on historical data. The task involved developing and evaluating three distinct models:
Model 1: Predicts current temperature using historical temperature values.
Model 2: Predicts current temperature using historical brightness values.
Model 3: Uses both historical brightness and temperature values to predict current temperature.
For each model, the algorithm choice varied to best suit the data, and performance was evaluated by plotting the current temperature vs. time for all three models. This visualization also included predictions beyond the last collected data point, highlighting the modelsâ€™ ability to generalize effectively.
This project demonstrates expertise in IoT data analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning algorithms for real-world applications.
